# About
A simple tool that allows you to play in private lobbies in [Red Dead Online](https://www.rockstargames.com/reddeadonline).<br>
If somebody uses the same passphrase as you they'll be able to join you.

# Tutorial

1. Exit Red Dead if it is running
2. Run RDOP.exe
3. Double click the "RDR2 Location..." textbox
4. Locate and select RDR2.exe from the root directory of the game
5. Type in your passphrase
6. Save

##### Quick Notes
* **Running as admin may be required depending on the location and or folder permissions of the game**
* **If the legal screens still appear after saving that probably means R\* has patched this method**
* **The passphrase IS case and whitespace sensitive**

# ⚠️ Warning ⚠️
This method of private lobbies has been around for about 2 years, and to my current knowledge nobody has been banned for using it.<br>
It is a simple file mod that adds 2 files to the game, no custom code or memory editing.<br>
**But remember that with any tool or modification there is always a risk of getting banned.**
