# About
A simple tool that allows you to play in private lobbies in [Red Dead Online](https://www.rockstargames.com/reddeadonline).<br>
If somebody uses the same passphrase as you they'll be able to join you.

# Tutorial

**Running as admin may be required depending on the location and or folder permissions of the game**

* Exit Red Dead if it is running.
* Run RDOP.exe
* Double click the "RDR2 Location..." textbox
* Locate and select RDR2.exe from the root directory of the game
* Type in your passphrase
* Save

# Warning
This method of private lobbies has been around for about 2 years, and to my current knowledge nobody has been banned for using it.<br>
It is a simple file mod that changes 2 files in the game, no custom code or memory editing.<br>
**But remember that with any tool or modification there is always a risk of getting banned.**
